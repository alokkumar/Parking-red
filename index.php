							<p>This web-based system is a proposal for the design and development of a parking lot management system that will track the entry and exit of cars, maintain a listing of cars within the parking lot, and determine if the parking lot is full or not. There is a very clean and interactive web page designed for the user. The website can be used for future booking of the parking slots if the slot is not empty at that time it will simply tell the user that the “Slot is not empty”. After selecting the parking slot user has to just enter its name, vehicle number…etc and proceed to payment. The slot will be booked by his/her name for that period of time. Another user trying to book the same slot within the same time period will get the message that the slot is not empty.</p>
